                </div>
                <h6>Planning for retirement starts with thinking about your retirement goals and how long you have to meet them. Then you need to look at the types of retirement accounts that can help you raise the money to fund your future. As you save that
                    money, you have to invest it to enable it to grow. The surprise last part is taxes: If you’ve received tax deductions over the years for the money you’ve contributed to your retirement accounts, a significant tax bill awaits when you
                    start withdrawing those savings.

                </h6>
                <h6> There are ways to minimize the retirement tax hit while you save for the future—and to continue the process when that day arrives and you actually do retire. We’ll get into all of these issues here. But first, start by learning the five
                    steps everyone should take, no matter what their age, to build a solid retirement plan.</h6>

                <h6>Your current age and expected retirement age create the initial groundwork of an effective retirement strategy. The longer the time between today and retirement, the higher the level of risk your portfolio can withstand. If you’re young
                    and have 30-plus years until retirement, you should have the majority of your assets in riskier investments, such as stocks. Though there will be volatility, stocks have historically outperformed other securities, such as bonds, over
                    long time periods. The main word here is “long,” meaning at least more than 10 years.</h6>
